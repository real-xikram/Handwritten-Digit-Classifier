# Handwritten-Digit-Classifier
Detecting handwritten digits using a CNN model based on MNIST dataset in Keras

# Key Highlights
* A pattern classification system is built for handwritten digits using dataset from MNIST and the application GUI for inspection is created
* Trained and evaluated performances of SVM, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest and a CNN with a fully connected SoftMax layer
* Performed Data Augmentation and Batch Normalization for achieving classification accuracy of 89.35 % on Test Dataset 

# Dataset
  The dataset is directly loaded from Keras.
